<!--Problem/Solution  -->
<span>
<h2>Problem</h2></span>

<div><p>Pizza Vida is the only vegan pizza restaurant in the city and does not use any third-party delivery services.
They rely heavily on their own delivery and pick-up system through their website. 

The current website is not user-friendly and is difficult for customers to navigate, leading to frustration and lost orders.

Customers may have difficulty finding the menu or placing orders, or may experience delays or confusion with the delivery or pick-up process. 
This can lead to dissatisfaction among customers and result in lost business for Pizza Vida.</p></div>

<span>
<h2>Solution</h2></span>

<div><p>Pizza Vida mobile app aims to simplify the process of ordering pizza by providing an intuitive and streamlined ordering experience. 

With the app, customers can easily place orders for delivery or pickup, pay directly through the app, and track their order status in real-time. 

Additionally, a loyalty program and pre-order feature will be implemented to reward frequent customers and allow for scheduling of orders. Overall, the app will enhance the customer experience.</p></div>

<!--Competitive analysis  -->

<div>
<span><h2>Competitive analysis </h2></span>

<p> I searched into and analysed 2 pizza delivery-specific apps. The chain Panago offers a large selection of vegan pizzas at its many locations throughout Canada and the United States.
PICO is a Canadian company that does not offer a vegan menu, but their pizzas are simple to make using vegan ingredients, and they also offer vegan cheese for an additional cost. The company also has a large number of stores throughout Ontario and Vancouver.</p>

<br> 
<li>Panago offers a large selection of vegan pizzas.</li>
<li>Panago's app design is straightforward and attractive, with a clear menu and user-friendly features such as a cart at the bottom of the screen and explicit information about the order at checkout.</li>
<li>Panago offers many options, so using the kebab dots helps the app present all of the available options in a more organised way, preventing the user from becoming overly overwhelmed. </li>
<li>Panago provides explicit information about the order, including the ingredients and quantities, which is helpful because some people have a tendency to forget their orders, so it acts as a useful reminder. </li>
<li>Panago does not have a reward program.</li>
